## About Me

I'm a Research Engineer at the [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) and working at the [Biometry and Evolutionary Biology Lab, UMR 5558](https://lbbe-web.univ-lyon1.fr/fr)). I have a background in applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning and computer vision.
{style="color: white"}

In my PhD, I developed and implemented new methods for the automated analysis of camera trap images, leveraging deep learning to support ecological research. I’m an active member of the [DeepFaune](https://www.deepfaune.cnrs.fr/) project, where I contribute to model training, data curation, and software development.

Outside of research, I'm passionate about wildlife photography and naturalist activities.
