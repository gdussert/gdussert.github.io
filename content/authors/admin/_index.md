## About Me

I'm a PhD Student at [Université Lyon 1](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/) ([Biometry and Evolutionary Biology Lab, UMR 5558](https://lbbe-web.univ-lyon1.fr/fr)). I have a background in applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning and computer vision.

In my PhD, I develop and implement new methods for the automated analysis of camera trap images, leveraging deep learning to support ecological research. I’m an active member of the [DeepFaune](https://www.deepfaune.cnrs.fr/) project, where I contribute to model training, data curation, and software development.

Outside of research, I'm passionate about wildlife photography and naturalist activities.
